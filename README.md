# AQI Classification: Formally Verified with Coq and OCaml

This project implements a formally verified Air Quality Index (AQI) classifier using the [Coq](https://coq.inria.fr) proof assistant. The core properties — **mutual exclusion** and **complete coverage** — are proven in Coq and extracted to OCaml for reliable runtime classification.

This case study illustrates our framework's application to a standardized, publicly accessible classification system with well-defined, critical boundaries. It highlights how formal verification ensures the integrity of widely used public health tools and can be used to verify regulatory compliance. It demonstrates basic interval consistency (no overlaps, no gaps) in a fixed, clear, and critical regulatory context and emphasizes the **mathematical certainty** and **provably correct data partitioning** for a widely understood system.

## Prerequisites

- [OCaml 4.14.1](https://ocaml.org/)
- [OPAM](https://opam.ocaml.org/)
- [Dune](https://dune.build/)
- [Coq ≥ 8.18](https://coq.inria.fr/)

## Setup Instructions

```bash
opam switch create . ocaml-base-compiler.4.14.1
eval $(opam env)
opam install dune zarith coq
```

---

## Build and Run

```bash

## Evaluation Metrics

We evaluated our verified classifier using several quantitative metrics. All benchmarks were conducted on:

- **Device Name**: DESKTOP-PJLP2TU
- **CPU**: AMD Ryzen 3 3200G @ 3.60GHz
- **RAM**: 8GB
- **Storage**: 238GB SSD (KINGSTON SKC600256G)
- **OS**: Windows 10 + WSL2 (Ubuntu 22.04)

### Runtime Benchmarks
We timed the classification of 10,000 inputs using both the extracted OCaml classifier and a baseline Python version:

- **OCaml (Verified)**:
  ```bash
  time ./bench_ocaml.sh
  ```
  Result: ~0.9s for 10,000 classifications (avg: 0.09ms)

- **Python (Baseline)**:
  ```bash
  time python3 bench_python.py
  ```
  Result: ~5.1s for 10,000 classifications (avg: 0.51ms)

### Memory Footprint
- OCaml: <1MB (resident set size)
- Python: ~12MB (interpreter + script memory)

### Comparison Table

| Metric              | OCaml (Verified) | Python (Baseline) |
|---------------------|------------------|-------------------|
| Avg Classify Time   | 0.09 ms          | 0.51 ms           |
| Memory Footprint    | <1 MB            | ~12 MB            |
| Proven Correctness  | Coq Verified     | None              |
| Reproducibility     | Consistent       | Interpreter Dependent |

### Methodology
- Benchmarks were conducted using simple shell loops and averaged over 10,000 AQI values sampled uniformly from 0–500.
- All scripts and raw benchmark data are in `bench/`.

for i in $(cat bench/data.txt); do
  ./_build/default/ocaml/ocaml_main.exe "$i" > /dev/null
done
```

**bench_python.py**:
```python

    if aqi < 50.5: return "Good"
    elif aqi < 100.5: return "Moderate"
    elif aqi < 150.5: return "Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups"
    elif aqi < 200.5: return "Unhealthy"
    elif aqi < 300.5: return "Very Unhealthy"
    else: return "Hazardous"

with open("bench/data.txt") as f:
    for line in f:
        classify(float(line.strip()))
```

To generate input:
```bash
seq 0 0.05 500 > bench/data.txt
```
